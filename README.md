## ðŸ“„ SQL Task3

This SQL script performs a series of data retrieval and filtering operations on an **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)** table in the `employee` database. Key operations include:

- Filtering transactions by **state** (e.g., `Shipping_State = 'Delaware'`)
- Retrieving transactions within a **specific time window** (10:00 AM to 2:00 PM)
- Fetching transactions that occurred on a **specific date**
- Sorting transactions by **timestamp** in descending order
- Displaying **full customer names** by concatenating `Name` and `Surname` fields
- Filtering transactions containing specific keywords in the **description** (e.g., "discount" or "Set")

These queries are designed for exploring, analyzing, and reporting transaction-level data efficiently.
